# Introduction

Welcome to the Memory Modulation Lab manual. This manual was developed by me, [Maureen Ritchey](http://www.thememolab.org/people/ritchey/). It is intended to represent my vision for how the lab should function and to complement existing Boston College [policies](http://www.bc.edu/offices/policies/universitypolicies.html) (which take precedence). **Upon joining the lab, all lab members are required to read the lab manual and sign a [form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dVIsL28tz7GCh6loME4LX2yn1bhKC0BKpLCwAt5I3Fs/edit?usp=sharing) indicating that they have done so.** I expect that more information will be added and some sections will be revised as the lab grows and develops. If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the contents of this manual, please tell me.

The MemoLab manual was inspired by other [similar](http://jpeelle.net/peellelab_manual.pdf) [works](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/coc.html). In some places, I have adapted or reproduced content from the [Peelle lab manual](https://github.com/jpeelle/peellelab_manual).
